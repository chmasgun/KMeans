# KMeans
KMeans algorithm for data in two dimensions. This code reads fixed pair of numbers from the readFile, which must be equal to number of
data in this file. Cluster variable determines how many groups (clusters) of data to create. After the execution of the clustering,
each cluster is written into different files. It is because I wanted this clusters to visualize in MATLAB. I have coded a simple I/O 
algorithm for visualization. Output of that code is also put here as MATLAB figure file.
